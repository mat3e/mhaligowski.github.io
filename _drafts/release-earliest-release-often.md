Release as early as possible, release often
===========================================
If you are a professional programmer or a startuper you probably came across the rule "Release early, release often". In the world of startups the implementation of that rule is early customer evaluation and building an MVP (Most-Viable-Product). In techies world a whole bunch of Continous Integration have been emerging since the beginning of the century after being presented as a best practice of XP.

Linus's open development policy was the very opposite of cathedral-building. Linux's Internet archives were burgeoning, multiple distributions were being floated. And all of this was driven by an unheard-of frequency of core system releases.

The excerpt comes from an essay of the Open Source guru and assigns the "Release Early, Release often" rule the no other but Linus Torvalds himself. The rule found later its way to eXtreme programming methodology as a "continous integration", and later fit perfectly into emerging Agile methodology:
>Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

The question is, what does it mean to release early. Provided you have worked in an agile environment, you probably utilize Jenkins or some similiar tool to fetch your repository, run the tests (you write unit tests, don't you?), and every week or two the project is promoted and deployed to the production. And that's great from the Agile point of view, which concentrates on better communication. Customer sees the new feature, the feature is reviewed, the feedback is given. Works like a charm.

I believe such approach from the point of view of a developer is misleading, as the CI seems to be merely a part of communication with a customer. In fact, it may and should also provide much more information, and I'm not talking here about the test reports.
