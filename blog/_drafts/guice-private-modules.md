Two weeks ago I was talking about the Reuse/Release Principle, which states that the unit of reuse is also the unit of release - whatever you want others to reuse, you need to release with a predictable schedule. The rule doesn't tell much about the code itself, different languages and frameworks will require different approaches to achieving that. On one hand you want to package all the classes that are meant to be reused, on the other hand you don't want the consumers hurt themselves with lower levels of abstractions or depend on something that is likely to change in the future.

Over the development of several projects I figured that the most convenient way to structure you code is using [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice). It is a [Dependency Inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) container, that's way easier to pick up than the more popular Spring Framework. Unfortunately, since it's so easy to pick up, many developers do not try to learn more about Guice. This leads to medium-sized projects with a single module, with ridiculous number of dependencies defined, and with very few reusable components. One thing that helps to keep you project easier to comprehend and maintain reusable modules is to use private modules.
