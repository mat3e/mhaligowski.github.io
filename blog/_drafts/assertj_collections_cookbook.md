When programming in Java you often end up writing methods returning a collection of objects. They certainly have their place in your application, but testing them can be a little tricky. Depending on the implementation of the underlying collection the order of the elements may be different, the `equals` on collections is not always obvious, and so on. I have come across multiple examples of such cases in my career, and I decided to pick a couple of them and show a way to tackle with AssertJ, the assertions library you should definitely be using.
