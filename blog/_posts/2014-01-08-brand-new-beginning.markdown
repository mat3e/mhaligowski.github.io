As a New Year resolution and a part of personal development I set up a GitHub Page ("blogging the hacker way") intending to be my blog, and also contain some information about my projects, talks etc.

I am rather lame when it comes to webdesign, so I have to give credit to Zach Holman from GitHub and his great Jekyll template [Left](https://www.github.com/holman/left). I took a lot of inspiration from that, spiced it up a little with [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/) for grids, added some icons and that's it! I spent a single evening on that (just the blog part) and for that amount of time I guess it looks fine enough.

Stay tuned for more and have a great 2014.
